                <p>There is an old latin proverb, <em>repetitio est mater studiorum</em>, which means <em>repetition is the mother of learning</em>.</p>
                <p>The proverb may be old but it still holds true; we learn the alphabet by repeating it over and over and we learn to ride a bike by falling and getting up again until we have mastered riding it.</p>
                <p>Learning a new language is no different, we must listen to, speak, read and write the words of the language <em>thousands</em> of times before becoming fluent.</p>
                <p>Actually, to tell the truth, there's no way around the "thousands of time" bit. There are no silver bullets. <b>You have to work hard to learn a new language!</b></p>
                <h3 class="text-muted">So now what?</h3>
                <p>Thankfully, there are tools to make our lives a little bit easier when memorizing, for instance, the numerals or verb forms of a language.</p>
                <p>On this web site you'll find typing exercises for memorizing spanish verbs, numerals and glossary, all free and open, no registration or login needed.</p>
